                  As with all MetaCoders classes, we're here to get better at two things:

                  @ul{
                    @li{Coding}
                    @li{Learning}
                  }
                  In order to practice either one of those, we need a language to learn.  That way, we can learn that language -- and (more importantly) we can learn @i{how to learn} languages.

                  In this class, we're going to be using a language named @coach-fills-in{#lang _______}.   I've been learning this language myself, and I want to tell you about a few of its interesting features.

                  @coach-fills-in{Mention one or two features of the language.}

                  As with any language, there are easy things about it.  And there are hard things about it.  But we're going to work together as a class to find things that are just right -- not to easy, and not too hard.  That way we can increase our brains' abilities to read and write in that new language.  

                  @(class-intro:questions-1)

                  Lastly, this class is going to involve challenging ourselves with various games.  For some of those games, I'll be giving out rewards and prizes!  
                  
                  @coach-fills-in{Any additional information about your intended gamification in this class.}

                  Also, the class as a whole is a kind of like a game -- because you'll be getting @b{badges} every few weeks just for showing up and working hard.  Remember that 100% of winning is showing up.
